  "description": "RemasteredLogger is a logger as simple as it is complex, it uses SLF4j as an API base. This logger provides the developer with ease of use for a wide variety of utility. This also allows the simplicity of saving under several loggers but also the complexity of being able to create 'Class' or single event loggers.",
